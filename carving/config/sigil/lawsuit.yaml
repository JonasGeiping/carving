  When Barack Obama joined Silicon Valley’s top luminaries for dinner in California last February,
  each guest was asked to come with a question for the president.
  But as Steven P. Jobs of Apple spoke, President Obama interrupted with an inquiry of his own: what
  would it take to make iPhones in the United States?
  Not long ago, Apple boasted that its products were made in America. Today, few are. Almost all
  of the 70 million iPhones, 30 million iPads and 59 million other products Apple sold last year were
  manufactured overseas.
  Why can’t that work come home? Mr. Obama asked.
  Mr. Jobs’s reply was unambiguous. “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” he said, according to another
  dinner guest.
  The president’s question touched upon a central conviction at Apple. It isn’t just that workers are
  cheaper abroad. Rather, Apple’s executives believe the vast scale of overseas factories as well as the
  fexibility, diligence and industrial skills of foreign workers have so outpaced their American counterparts
  that “Made in the U.S.A.” is no longer a viable option for most Apple products.
  Apple has become one of the best-known, most admired and most imitated companies on earth, in
  part through an unrelenting mastery of global operations. Last year, it earned over $400,000 in proft
  per employee, more than Goldman Sachs, Exxon Mobil or Google.
  However, what has vexed Mr. Obama as well as economists and policy makers is that Apple — and

  many of its high-technology peers — are not nearly as avid in creating American jobs as other famous companies were in their heydays.
  Apple employs 43,000 people in the United States and 20,000 overseas, a small fraction of the over 400,000 American workers at General Motors in the
  1950s, or the hundreds of thousands at General Electric in the 1980s. Many more people work for Apple’s contractors: an additional 700,000 people engineer, build and assemble iPads, iPhones and Apple’s
  other products. But almost none of them work in the United States. Instead, they work for foreign companies in Asia, Europe and elsewhere,
  at factories that almost all electronics designers rely upon to build their wares.
